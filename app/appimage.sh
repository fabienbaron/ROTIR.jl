# Package the built bundle as a single-file AppImage.
#
#     xvfb-run -a julia --project=bin app/build.jl    # first: produce build/ROTIR
#     app/appimage.sh                                 # then: ROTIR-x86_64.AppImage
#
# An AppImage is a squashfs image with a small runtime prepended: running it mounts the image
# and executes AppRun inside. So the user gets ONE executable file rather than the 3.2 GB
# directory `create_app` produces, and nothing is installed or unpacked.
#
# WHY THE PATHS STILL WORK. The mount point is a fresh /tmp/.mount_XXXXXX every launch, so
# nothing may assume a fixed location — which is exactly the property `resource()` was built
# for: it anchors on `<Sys.BINDIR>/../share/rotir`, and Sys.BINDIR follows the mount. The same
# is true of the Makie font atlas, which is seeded into the user's own cache rather than
# written beside the binary, and of the orbit presets, which `orbit_dir()` copies into the
# user's config directory on first run.
#
# COMPRESSION IS A TRADE, not a free win. The image is decompressed BLOCK BY BLOCK as it is
# read, so a smaller file costs CPU on every launch — and this payload is a ~1.5 GB sysimage
# that gets mapped at startup.
#
# THE COMPRESSOR IS NOT A CHOICE HERE. The appimagetool this script downloads carries its own
# mksquashfs, and that build supports **zstd only** — `--comp xz` fails outright with
# "Compressor \"xz\" is not supported". ROTIR_APPIMAGE_COMP exists for a host mksquashfs that
# has more, and is otherwise nothing to turn.
#
# THE TWO LEVERS THAT DO WORK ARE THE BLOCK SIZE AND THE LEVEL, AND THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT.
# squashfs compresses each block on its own, so at the 128K default a high zstd level has too
# little data in front of it to find matches in. Measured by OITOOLS on ITS bundle (2.6 GB
# staged) — not re-measured here, and this bundle is larger, so treat the numbers as the shape
# of the trade rather than as predictions:
#
#     blocks   level     AppImage    packing
#     128K     15        589.0 MB     11 s     <- appimagetool's defaults
#     1M       15        569.3 MB      9 s     -19.7 MB
#     128K     19        582.7 MB     27 s      -6.3 MB
#     1M       19        523.2 MB     25 s     -65.8 MB
#
# Neither alone is worth much and together they took 11.2% off: the block size is what lets the
# level pay. Both are defaulted on below. Level costs build time and NOT launch time — zstd
# decompression speed barely depends on it — and a 1M block is read-ahead rather than waste
# here, because a sysimage is read broadly rather than in scattered fragments.
#
# Not a compression trick, but the real bandwidth win for repeat users: `-u <update string>`
# writes a zsync file, and a later AppImage is then fetched as a DELTA against the one already
# on disk. It needs a published URL, so it belongs to whatever hosts the releases.
