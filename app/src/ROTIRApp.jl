# The application entry point.
#
# WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT AN APPLICATION, and it is not obvious: a bundle is a sysimage, and
# every package `__init__` in a sysimage runs BEFORE any user code. By the time `julia_main`
# gets control, GLFW has called `glfwInit` and QML has constructed its `QGuiApplication`.
#
# So two of the three ordering hooks that `bin/rotirgui.jl` relies on cannot work here:
# `prefer_native_wayland!` needs to run before `glfwInit`, and `configure_qt_platform!` before
# Qt starts, and both have already happened. Only `configure_graphics!` survives, because Mesa
# reads its variables when the GL CONTEXT is created and that happens later, inside `gui`.
#
# The consequence is the reason `launcher.sh` exists. Left alone on a Wayland session, GLFW
# takes its hardcoded X11 and Qt follows the session to Wayland — the SPLIT configuration, two
# windowing systems and two EGL connections in one process, which is the state
# `prefer_native_wayland!` was written to prevent. The launcher sets the variables before the
# process starts, which is the only moment that still works.
#
# `rotirgui()` is deliberately not used. It offers to install missing optional packages, and an
# application cannot: its depot is read-only and its user never installed Julia. Every optional
# engine is an ordinary dependency in Project.toml instead, so nothing is greyed out and
# nothing is ever offered.

Makie caches the atlas in a scratch space inside the DEPOT, which in an installed bundle is
read-only: it would then try to download the atlas from GitHub on every launch and, failing
that, re-render every glyph with a warning, having nowhere to store the result. A per-user

Tell Qt where the bundled `Makie` QML module is.

QMLMakie registers its own module from `__init__` with
`QML.add_import_path(joinpath(@__DIR__, "qml"))`, and `@__DIR__` is expanded at PRECOMPILE
time — so the path in the image is the package directory of the machine that BUILT the bundle.
It does not exist on the machine running it, Qt finds no module, and every `.qml` that says
`import Makie` fails with `module "Makie" is not installed` before the window appears.

`build.jl` stages those few kB beside the other resources; this points Qt at them. A checkout
needs none of it — `resource` returns `nothing` there and QMLMakie's own path is live.
